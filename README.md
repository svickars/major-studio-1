## Data Review

1. Selected Data Sources

    - **Gender Inequality in the Education System and its Effects on the Labour Market**  
        The UN’s Gender Inequality Index measures the inequality in achievement between men and women in reproductive health, empowerment, and the labour market. Out of 152 countries measured, only three African countries score above the median, while 28 of 39 African countries score in the worst quartile. An important factor in this inequality is access to education. The data set shows progress over the last two decades at the primary school level, but the opposite at the secondary and tertiary levels. The second data set predictably shows a gender imbalance in the employment trends in Africa, where only 14% of working women are in wage employment, compared to 29% of working men.   
        *Note: Some references link a decrease in female school attendance to a decrease in rainfall. Sufficient data?*

        This data set compares male employment-to-population ratios to email employment-to-population ratios around the world to show global employment trends for women.
    
    - **Changes in Governance and Governance Indicators**  
        Since 1990, the African continent as transitioned toward more democratic leadership (four full electoral democracies in 1990 to twenty in 2016, according to Freedom House). That being said, trends across three of four governance indicators (corruption, effectiveness, and regulatory quality) are worsening, while positive trends are shown in one: voice and accountability. This increasing ability to participate in electing governments and greater freedom of expression suggests a clear link to increase in democratic leadership.

        [Worldwide Governance Indicators](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/Governance/id/398b56e9)  
        This data set shows Control of Corruption, Government Effectiveness, Political Stability, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, and Voice and Accountability ranks across Sub-Saharan Africa over the last two decades.

    - **Political Freedoms**  
        Table 3 compares the resource dependency of African countries to their political rights scores (out of 7, 1 being the best), finding that the more dependant on natural resources a country is, the higher their political rights score, on average. According to Freedom House’s methodology, most of the high-scoring countries are not considered “free”.

3. Questions

    **1.** Most graphs comparing gender enrolment in african schools directly compare the number of boys attending to the number of girls attending. Would showing the fraction of girls attending school (vs. not attending school), and how that number is (or is not) improving be more telling?  
    **2.** How are governance indicators like corruption control, government effectiveness, and voice and accountability measured? And how accurate is this data?  
    **3.** Are countries more politcally-restricted because of their high dependency on natural resources or are they more dependent on natural resources because of their low political freedom?
