                <h2>Democracy Index</h2>
                <h6>The Democracy Index is compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which measures the state of democracy in 167 countries. The index is based on 60 indicators from five categories and measures pluralism, civil liberties, and politcal cultures. Data is available for 2006, 2008, 2010, and each year since then. Countries are classified into one of four regime types: full democracy, flawed democracy, hybrid regime, or authoritarian regime. See the <a href='http://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=DemocracyIndex2015'> Economist Intelligence Unit's website</a> for more details.</a>
