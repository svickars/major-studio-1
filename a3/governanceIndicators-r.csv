Opposition discontent with the continued delay of local elections, originally scheduled for April 2013 but postponed following problems with the electronic voter roll system'led to protests in 2014, including a mass demonstration held in October in the economic capital, Cotonou. Opposition members also expressed discontent at continued attempts by Yayi's coalition to pass controversial constitutional reforms through the National Assembly, with critics worried that the changes would allow Yayi to run for a third presidential term. After the proposals were repeatedly rejected, Yayi publicly declared an end to the particular reform initiative, though the issue was widely discussed throughout the year.

The ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) won the most seats in the tightest race in the country's history. President Seretse Khama Ian Khama was reelected for a second term. Despite allegations of intimidation and violence against opposition party members and journalists in the run-up to the elections, the environment was largely peaceful.<br><br>

The BDP faces increasing opposition, and critics accuse Khama of creeping authoritarianism. Shortly after being sworn in, the retired army general insisted that new members of parliament vote for a vice president by show of hands rather than secret ballot. This attempt to position his brother to fill the role was thwarted by a court ruling in November. Political tensions increased further in July, following the death of leading opposition party leader Gomolemo Motswaledi in a traffic accident that some believed to be a possible assassination.<br><br>

A proposed change to the constitution to allow President Blaise Compaoré to suspend term limits and run in the 2015 presidential election caused disagreement within and between the country's political parties. The government and opposition clashed throughout the year over the issue, and mass opposition protests led to confrontations with security forces in late October.

After a late-year spike in terrorist attacks, President Uhuru Kenyatta in December signed the Security Laws (Amendment) Act, which gave the government expansive powers to restrict basic rights in the interest of national security. Among other controversial clauses, the legislation authorized the government to monitor and intercept communications, detain terrorism suspects without charge for up to one year, and restrict media reporting on terrorism and related issues. Also that month, the Non-Governmental Organizations Coordination Board deregistered more than 340 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that it claimed had not submitted financial records, alleging that they were 'vulnerable to abuse as conduits of terrorism financing and money laundering.' The deteriorating security situation toward the end of the year sparked protests in Nairobi and led to the replacement of Kenya's police chief and the cabinet secretary of the interior.
<br><br>
While Kenyatta remained popular in 2014, his government continued to face challenges from former prime minister Raila Odinga's Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD). In July, CORD led the so-called Saba Saba rally to protest increasing insecurity and call for a national dialogue on rising ethnic tensions. More than 10,000 people participated in the rally, during which opposition leaders also proposed a referendum to address major issues including land reform and devolution of power to regional governments.
<br><br>
International Criminal Court (ICC) cases against Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto for crimes against humanity in connection with 2007-08 postelection violence continued to unravel in 2014. As in the previous year, prosecution witnesses disappeared or withdrew amid threats, and civil society organizations and media outlets that focused on the trials faced intimidation. In September, the parliament voted in favor of the country's withdrawal from the ICC, a process that would take up to a year to complete. Lawmakers argued that the ICC cases were politically motivated and infringed on Kenya's sovereignty. Kenyatta in October attended a hearing on his case in The Hague, the Netherlands, becoming the first sitting head of state to appear before the court. In December, ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda announced the withdrawal of charges against Kenyatta, citing a lack of evidence and the Kenyan government's failure to cooperate. The case against Ruto was ongoing as of the end of 2014.",4,4,4,https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2015/kenya,4.34,5.55

Kamoli escaped to the mountains with approximately 200 soldiers and a large number of weapons. Fearing a motion of confidence, Thabane had suspended the Parliament in June.

In September, in a highly unusual move, the UN Security Council unanimously declared the crisis a threat to international peace and security.
<br><br>
The crisis prompted the Liberian government to impose a state of emergency in August, announcing that some freedoms would have to be curtailed to fight the virus. The Ebola epidemic was used as a rationale for placing new restrictions on journalists, for the closure of all schools and land borders, and for postponement of senatorial elections scheduled for October. The government also imposed a nationwide nighttime curfew and quarantined several Ebola-stricken areas, including the West Point slum in Monrovia. The latter move was widely criticized and led to clashes between West Point residents and police. The quarantine was lifted after 10 days.
<br><br>
President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf initially defended her administration's efforts to contain Ebola, blaming its spread on the public's ignorance and refusal to heed government and health worker warnings. In October, however, she expressed public regret for measures taken early in the crisis, including the quarantines. In November, she lifted the state of emergency, citing progress in combating the epidemic.

In December 2014 he took steps toward national reconciliation, inviting four of his presidential predecessors, including Rajoelina and Marc Ravalomanana, to meet for talks supported by the Southern African Development Community (SADC).

The government was criticized for its slow response and for the extreme measures it took, such as 'closing down' the entire country to curb the spread of the virus. In October, in what public health workers described as an admission of defeat, the government approved plans to help families care for Ebola patients at home rather than seek treatment at overburdened, understaffed clinics and hospitals. The rate of transmission surged in the latter months of the year.

The fighting quickly assumed ethnic dimensions, with targeted killings carried out by both sides. As in previous conflicts, civilians were not only caught up in the fighting, but were specifically targeted by the combatants--even as they took shelter in hospitals, places of worship, and UN facilities.
<br><br>
Serious fighting engulfed 3 of South Sudan's 10 states, with the heaviest clashes taking place in the oil-producing states of Upper Nile and Unity, as well as in adjacent Jonglei state; in all three states, large numbers of soldiers from the Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army (SPLA) defected to the opposition. Both sides drew support from an assortment of domestic and foreign militia groups.
<br><br>
A cessation of hostilities agreement reached in January made little difference on the ground. Both sides continued to interfere with humanitarian access to the worst-affected areas and appeared immune to international pressure, including the announcement of sanctions by the United States and European Union against some of the key protagonists. Negotiations dragged on, with neither side showing any urgency to end the fighting.

By the end of the year, an estimated 1.9 million people had been displaced by the conflict. Almost 100,000 were taking shelter at UN bases throughout the country.

<br><br>
The ruling National Congress Party (NCP)'s renewed pressure on opponents soon obscured this optimism. The so-called National Dialogue failed to achieve results, and by the spring, participants were accusing the NCP of acting in bad faith and stalling the negotiations to perpetuate its hold on power. In summer, many of Sudan's parties--the exception being al-Turabi's Popular Congress Party--had again lined up against the NCP, signing a pact with the main armed opponents of the regime, the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF), in August. The document called for the formation of a transitional all-party government that would convene a constitutional conference.

In October President al-Bashir was nominated as the NCP's candidate in presidential elections scheduled for April 2015.

Although Sata had appointed Defense and Justice Minister Edgar Lungu, who was also the secretary general of the ruling Patriotic Front (PF) party, acting president when he left the country October 19 for medical treatment, Vice President Guy Scott assumed the presidency upon Sata's death. This was in accordance with the constitution, though initially there was some contention in the party surrounding Scott's elevation. An election for Sata's successor was scheduled for January 20, 2015; the ballot is required to be held within 90 days of the incumbent's death. Scott, whose parents were born in Britain, is constitutionally barred from running for president. The president's death deepened existing divisions in the PF over the selection of a successor to the longtime party leader, and tensions between Scott and Lungu precipitated public rifts in the PF. By late December, however, these rifts were healed, at least publicly, and Scott and most PF leaders fell in behind Lungu's candidacy.

Sata died just four days after Zambia marked 50 years of independence from the United Kingdom. In what was seen as an attempt to appease critics, the PF-led government released to the public the long-delayed draft of a new constitution on the day before the Golden Jubilee celebrations.
