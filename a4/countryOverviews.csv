Corruption is pervasive and the independent media are still subject to legal and physical harassment. Mostly urban-based anticorruption and antigovernment protests that had begun in 2011 expanded in 2013 and continued in 2014. Demonstrators faced violent dispersal and intimidation; several were arrested and beaten, and some were killed.

After a moderate slowing of Angola�s gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2013, Angola�s economy sped up again in 2014.

Opposition discontent with the continued delay of local elections�originally scheduled for April 2013 but postponed following problems with the electronic voter roll system�led to protests in 2014, including a mass demonstration held in October in the economic capital, Cotonou. Opposition members also expressed discontent at continued attempts by Yayi�s coalition to pass controversial constitutional reforms through the National Assembly, with critics worried that the changes would allow Yayi to run for a third presidential term. After the proposals were repeatedly rejected, Yayi publicly declared an end to the particular reform initiative, though the issue was widely discussed throughout the year.

Despite allegations of intimidation and violence against opposition party members and journalists in the run-up to the elections, the environment was largely peaceful.

The BDP faces increasing opposition, and critics accuse Khama of creeping authoritarianism. Shortly after being sworn in, the retired army general insisted that new members of parliament vote for a vice president by show of hands rather than secret ballot. This attempt to position his brother to fill the role was thwarted by a court ruling in November. Political tensions increased further in July, following the death of leading opposition party leader Gomolemo Motswaledi in a traffic accident that some believed to be a possible assassination.

The Far North province, which borders the stronghold of Boko Haram in Nigeria, faces increasing incursions from the Islamic militant group. Instability in neighboring Central African Republic, which shares a 500-mile-long border with Cameroon, has also led to increasing confrontations between Cameroon�s military and rebel groups.

As part of government�s response to the rise in extremist violence, in December President Paul Biya signed a sweeping new antiterrorism law. However, the law was criticized by the opposition, media, and civil society groups as severely restricting freedom of speech and assembly. It imposed the death penalty for �acts of terrorism�; however, critics alleged that such acts were vaguely defined and that the law could be used to silence dissent.

Political instability, violence, religious cleansing, and the massive internal displacement of more than one million people in the ongoing conflict between the largely Muslim S�l�ka forces responsible for the 2013 coup and Christian militias known as anti-Balaka, who include supporters of ousted president Fran�ois Boziz�, continued to worsen the country�s humanitarian crisis.

Chad maintained some troops in Mali after beginning to withdraw in May 2013. Chad had originally sent 2,000 troops in early 2013 to help drive out Islamist fighters as part of an intervention spearheaded by France, D�by�s longtime ally. In September 2014, after five of its soldiers were killed, Chad accused the UN mission in Mali of neglect.

In March 2014, Chadian soldiers were accused of human rights abuses in CAR, where Chad has contributed substantially to an African Union peacekeeping force. President D�by claimed that the accusations were efforts to tarnish the country�s reputation, and ordered a full withdrawal of its troops. Chad began to play an important role in France�s Op�ration Barkhane, which aims to fight the Islamist threat in the Sahel. Opposition actors, who say that foreign countries are propping up President D�by and choosing regional stability over the internal politics of Chad, have criticized this decision.

The national army, the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC), remained implicated in human rights violations, with little effective civilian control over its activities. Journalists and human rights advocates continued to face threats, unlawful detention, and beatings by state security forces and rebel groups around the country. In some cases, opposition lawmakers were arrested and imprisoned for speaking out against the government.

Despite progress implementing 2013 accords that formally ended hostilities between the national army and the M23, numerous rebel groups remain active in the provinces of North Kivu, South Kivu, Orientale, and Katanga, contributing to mass internal displacement.

After a late-year spike in terrorist attacks, President Uhuru Kenyatta in December signed the Security Laws (Amendment) Act, which gave the government expansive powers to restrict basic rights in the interest of national security. Among other controversial clauses, the legislation authorized the government to monitor and intercept communications, detain terrorism suspects without charge for up to one year, and restrict media reporting on terrorism and related issues. Also that month, the Non-Governmental Organizations Coordination Board deregistered more than 340 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that it claimed had not submitted financial records, alleging that they were �vulnerable to abuse as conduits of terrorism financing and money laundering.� The deteriorating security situation toward the end of the year sparked protests in Nairobi and led to the replacement of Kenya�s police chief and the cabinet secretary of the interior.

However, local and international observers said the vote was generally credible. The DPP also won the most seats in the unicameral National Assembly, but not enough to gain a majority.

As president, Mutharika pledged to address pressing issues such as restoring the donor community�s faith in Malawi in the wake of the so-called Cashgate corruption scandal, in which more than $30 million in state funds was embezzled by mid-level government employees between 2009 and 2013. Some opposition and civil society figures expressed concern that the new president might restart some of the antidemocratic policies of his late brother and former president Bingu wa Mutharika.

President Ibrahim Boubacar Ke�ta appointed a former electoral rival, Moussa Mara, as the country�s new prime minister on April 5. Former prime minister Oumar Tatam Ly had resigned with no official explanation, but it later emerged that he had felt unable to institute needed reforms.

Two more round of talks took place in September and November, with little resolution except to continue the effort.

Meanwhile, the cease-fire remained fragile, with Tuareg groups and Islamist militants clashing with Malian, French, and UN troops. Governance in the North remained tenuous.

Boko Haram�s attacks and the Nigerian government�s counterinsurgency operations resulted in at least 10,850 deaths during the year.
