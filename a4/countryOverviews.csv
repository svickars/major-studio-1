"Angola","2014","Central","No","Not Free","5.5","5","6","angola","President José Eduardo dos Santos and his party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), continue to exercise tight control over Angola’s political system. The president unilaterally decided to postpone municipal elections that had been expected in 2014 until after the 2017 general elections.

Corruption is pervasive and the independent media are still subject to legal and physical harassment. Mostly urban-based anticorruption and antigovernment protests that had begun in 2011 expanded in 2013 and continued in 2014. Demonstrators faced violent dispersal and intimidation; several were arrested and beaten, and some were killed.

After a moderate slowing of Angola’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2013, Angola’s economy sped up again in 2014. A July report from the World Bank warned of possible long-term ill effects of a narrowing current-account surplus as the country’s oil-export earnings decline amid a global price decrease and as imports increase.","https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2015/angola"
"Benin","2014","Western","Yes","Free","2","2","2","benin","Although Benin remains among the most stable democracies in West Africa, its political sphere in 2014 was characterized by tensions surrounding public discontent with President Thomas Boni Yayi, the consequences of alleged coup attempts in 2012 and 2013, proposed constitutional reforms, and delayed local elections. Opposition discontent with the continued delay of local elections—originally scheduled for April 2013 but postponed following problems with the electronic voter roll system—led to protests in 2014, including a mass demonstration held in October in the economic capital, Cotonou. Opposition members also expressed discontent at continued attempts by Yayi’s coalition to pass controversial constitutional reforms through the National Assembly, with critics worried that the changes would allow Yayi to run for a third presidential term. After the proposals were repeatedly rejected, Yayi publicly declared an end to the particular reform initiative, though the issue was widely discussed throughout the year. In May, the president extended a pardon to the alleged participants of a 2012 coup attempt, most of whom had been imprisoned.","https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2015/benin"
"Botswana","2014","Southern","Yes","Free","2.5","2","3","botswana","In October 2014, Botswana—the world’s largest diamond producing country and the only one to have successive democratic elections since independence—held its 11th general election. The ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) won the most seats in the tightest race in the country’s history. President Seretse Khama Ian Khama was reelected for a second term. Despite allegations of intimidation and violence against opposition party members and journalists in the run-up to the elections, the environment was largely peaceful.

The BDP faces increasing opposition, and critics accuse Khama of creeping authoritarianism. Shortly after being sworn in, the retired army general insisted that new members of parliament vote for a vice president by show of hands rather than secret ballot. This attempt to position his brother to fill the role was thwarted by a court ruling in November. Political tensions increased further in July, following the death of leading opposition party leader Gomolemo Motswaledi in a traffic accident that some believed to be a possible assassination.

In September, police officers arrested two journalists and raided the offices of the Sunday Standard under the auspices of a colonial-era sedition law.","https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2015/botswana"

A proposed change to the constitution to allow President Blaise Compaoré to suspend term limits and run in the 2015 presidential election caused disagreement within and between the country’s political parties. The government and opposition clashed throughout the year over the issue, and mass opposition protests led to confrontations with security forces in late October. Following a declaration of a state of emergency on October 30, Compaoré stepped down from office, and the country came under military rule. A transitional government took power in mid-November.","https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2015/burkina-faso"
"Burundi","2014","Eastern","No","Not Free","5.5","5","6","burundi","Burundi’s authoritarian government increased its crackdown on opposition parties and restricted freedom of assembly in 2014. Against the backdrop of national elections scheduled for mid-2015, the ruling party continually disrupted the activities and targeted the members of opposition groups. In the government’s harshest move, in March, police arrested 70 people in Bujumbura for allegedly planning to participate in an opposition protest and subjected the group to a summary one-day trial.

Throughout 2014, outlets critical of the government were threatened with closure. In March, press freedom was further undermined when the president appointed six progovernment representatives to the media regulatory body. Authorities also regularly obstructed peaceful demonstrations and organized meetings ion 2014, including a peaceful Women’s Day march organized by the women’s league of the opposition Unity for National Progress (UPRONA) party in Bujumbura.

A law creating a truth and reconciliation commission was passed in April in a vote boycotted by opposition members, who expressed concern over the commission’s lack of independence. A new land law, adopted in January, was condemned by critics who argued that it could shift the country back into ethnic conflict.","https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2015/burundi"

The ten-island nation continued to rely heavily on international aid, agricultural imports, and foreign loans in 2014. Although Cape Verde is considered one of the least corrupt countries in Africa, the government was criticized by opposition members in 2014 for financial misconduct in public construction and infrastructure projects.","https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2015/cape-verde"
"Cameroon","2014","Central","No","Not Free","6","6","6","cameroon","Cameroon saw growing fault lines in 2014, the result of a worsening security situation in the country’s north and east, high youth unemployment, aging political leadership, and the lack of an obvious presidential heir in the ruling party. The Far North province, which borders the stronghold of Boko Haram in Nigeria, faces increasing incursions from the Islamic militant group. Instability in neighboring Central African Republic, which shares a 500-mile-long border with Cameroon, has also led to increasing confrontations between Cameroon’s military and rebel groups.

As part of government’s response to the rise in extremist violence, in December President Paul Biya signed a sweeping new antiterrorism law. However, the law was criticized by the opposition, media, and civil society groups as severely restricting freedom of speech and assembly. It imposed the death penalty for “acts of terrorism”; however, critics alleged that such acts were vaguely defined and that the law could be used to silence dissent.

While arrests for same-sex sexual behavior have declined, Cameroon still has the highest number of individuals in prison for such acts in the world. As of early 2014, at least 15 men and women were in prison because they were believed to be gay.","https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2015/cameroon"

Samba-Panza has no affiliation to any of the rebel groups involved in the conflict.

Political instability, violence, religious cleansing, and the massive internal displacement of more than one million people in the ongoing conflict between the largely Muslim Séléka forces responsible for the 2013 coup and Christian militias known as anti-Balaka, who include supporters of ousted president François Bozizé, continued to worsen the country’s humanitarian crisis. In February 2014, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon launched the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Central African Republic (MINUSCA), authorizing more than 11,000 UN troops to join the African-led peacekeeping forces already stationed in CAR since 2013.

In July 2014, Séléka and anti-Balaka signed a cease-fire agreement, but implementation of the accord proved short-lived. Séléka military chief Joseph Zoundeiko ignored the cease-fire and called for a partition of the country along religious lines.

In September 2014, the International Criminal Court (ICC) opened a probe into the CAR conflict, citing widespread incidences of rape, murder, forced displacement, persecution, and pillaging since 2012. According to the Associated Press, more than 5,000 people were killed from December 2013 to September 2014, and this is likely a vast underestimation due to the difficulty of collecting accurate data.","https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2015/central-african-republic"
